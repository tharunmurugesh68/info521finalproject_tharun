Project: Inflation forecasting model (Animesh Kumar Jha, Sarthak Chauhan, Abhiraj Rana)
Name: Tharun Murugesh Rajeswaran

## Provide a brief description of the project

As far as economics is concerned, inflation can be defined as the overall increase in the costs of goods and services throughout a country. Each unit of currency may purchase fewer products and services as the overall price level rises, hence inflation is associated with the decline in the buying power of money. Inflation can be measured using the "Consumer Price Index (CPI)," which calculates the percentage change in the cost of a selection of products and services that households use, is the most well-known measure of inflation. The model that the group aims to create is to predict the inflation rates for the United States of America using a dataset that provides the necessary values, as the inflation rate has been skyrocketing in the past few months, it has become necessary for everyone to budget their finanaces for present and future. Similar studies have been done on a global scale or for specifically a single country such as Brazil in the survey paper that the group has reviwed ("https://www.cemla.org/actividades/2020-final/2020-10-xxv-meeting-cbrn/Session%202/3.%20Machine_Learning...%20Wagner%20Piazza.pdf"). Knowledge gap would be about the dataset, which variables most affect the prediction system and which model will best fit the dataset and provide the best accuracy for prediction.

## What changes would you recommend?

1. Upon going through their progress so far, the group has not mentioned much about  the data visuialization of their work. So, I would recommend the group to make use of visualizations which can highlight the inflations and the overall increase in prices of good and services.  
2. The amount of data used by the group seems to be insufficient which is resulting in their models providing inaccurate results. So, I would recommend the group to utilise data which has sufficient amount of data. The data they wish to use must be easy to pre-process.
