Project: Optimizing Suntran Rider Opportunity in Low Income neighborhoods
Name: Shanmuganathan Chokkalingam

## Provide a brief description of the project
This project intends to optimally predict the schedule of bus timings in low-income neighborhood regions in Tucson. They would be able to develop a score for each bus stop based on the income levels of the block group that it was contained in. The data was separated into two files scorer.csv and times.csv, that would allow to develop a scoring system based on the stop id, and also tells us which bus goes to which stops. Deep Q Learning Methods will be used to determine how to assess an adequate observation space.

## What changes would you recommend?
_Replace with your answer_
1. You could have explained more about the datasets that you are going to use in this project. 
2. You could have explained more about the algorithms that are used to develop a score for each bus stop based on the income levels of the block group.
